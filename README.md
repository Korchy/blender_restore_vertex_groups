# Restore Vertex Groups
Restore vertex groups in 2.9 after appending from 3.0

When you append objects created in Blender 3.0 to Blender 2.9x vertex groups in meshes could be lost,
and you can get meshes without vertex groups.

This add-on can help you to partially restore vertex groups for such meshes.

Attention:
-
The add-on can restore vertex groups but not their names!

After processing meshes with this add-on, you will get meshes with vertex groups named:

    Group
    Group.001
    Group.002
    ...
    etc

Therefore, after the add-on work, you need to manually rename vertex groups.
